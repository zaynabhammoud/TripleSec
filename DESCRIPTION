Description: The Triple Sec Algorithm is a clinical support algorithm for risk assesment of Alzheimers disease.
It's goal is to categorize patients with neurological symptoms into three 
categories. These three categories represent the risk of the patient progressing 
to Alzheimer's disease, dependent on the given biomarker values.
The three catergories, high risk, indiscriminate risk and low risk are defined by 
cutoff values of the biomarkers. These cutoff values are caluclated
dependent on user defined risk-threshold and ratio of patients.
The algorithm is made up of three functions: CV.one.prune.tree, design.tree and predict.tree.
The data, data parameters as well as the risk-threshold are given to CV.one.prune.tree. 
This function creates a table with all data and splits this in half, using the first half of the data to calculate the cutoff values, via 
design.tree and using the second half of the data to test the cutoff values via the function predict.tree.
Once predict.tree has returned the predictions for the data given, CV.one.prune.tree returns a table with the predicted data to the user including
a column for the prediction as well the accuracy and the effectiveness (?).
